# uni_utilities
A collection of odds and ends that I use to manage some of the more mundane parts of marking and module management.

- **mailmerge_to_customFilenameDoc.html** 
A simple HTML/JS page that will take a preformted word doc and a spreadsheet and create individually named word docs like a mailmerg. Like a mailmerg, it will also insert details like student numbers, names etc. into the word doc replacing a {{tag}}. I use this to generate named feedback files for student work.
